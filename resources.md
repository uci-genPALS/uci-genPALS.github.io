# Getting started with single-cell genomics analysis

In order to get the most out of genPALS, we recommend that everyone has a baseline
level of knowledge with regards to single-cell genomics data analysis by going through
the tutorial for [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.2/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)
or [Scanpy](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html), whether you are
a fan of R or python programming respectively. These tutorials are well written
and include all required details from how to install the software, where to download
a scRNA-seq dataset, and the code required to run the software. All in all it should take
no more than an afternoon to get through one of these tutorials.

# Where can I find more single-cell analysis tools?
[This database](https://www.scrna-tools.org/) curates nearly 1000 different
tools for a wide variety of different types of single-cell genomics analysis.
Unfortunately since there are so many tools, it is hard to tell which are actually good,
which is why we have the genPALS to community to help figure it out!

# Can I play with single-cell datasets without any coding?
Yes! You can explore many datasets across different species, diseases, and tissues
on the [UCSC Cell Browser](https://cells.ucsc.edu/).
