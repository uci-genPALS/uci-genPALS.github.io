## Inference and analysis of cell-cell communication using CellChat


Dr. Suoqin Jin gave a fantastic talk discussing CellChat, a tool for analyzing
cell-cell commmunication using single-cell transcriptomics data. CellChat is a
powerful analysis toolkit in R that allows for the visualization and analysis of
cell-cell communication in discrete cell clusters as well as continuous cell states and devlopmental trajectories. In their recent [Nature Communications publicaiton])(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21246-9), Suoqin and colleagues present the CellChat method itself and a real-world application in human skin datasets.

The following figure shows many different use cases for Cell-Chat:

## Getting Started with CellChat

The [CellChat github](https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat) is an extremely helpful resource for getting started with CellChat. The following links lead to different cellchat tutorials:

* [Full tutorial for CellChat analysis of a single dataset with detailed explanation of each function](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/blob/master/tutorial/CellChat-vignette.html)
* [Full tutorial for comparison analysis of multiple datasets](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/blob/master/tutorial/Comparison_analysis_of_multiple_datasets.html)
* [Comparison analysis of multiple datasets with different cellular compositions](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/blob/master/tutorial/Comparison_analysis_of_multiple_datasets_with_different_cellular_compositions.html)
* [Interface with other single-cell analysis toolkits (e.g., Seurat, SingleCellExperiment, Scanpy)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/blob/master/tutorial/Interface_with_other_single-cell_analysis_toolkits.html)
