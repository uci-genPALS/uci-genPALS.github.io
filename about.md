# Mission Statement

Recently there has been an explosion of genomics data and new bioinformatic methods,
largely due to biotechnological advances that have enabled the field as a whole to
shift from studying whole tissue samples (bulk) to individual cells or nuclei. The
best practices for analyzing this data are not well established, especially
when new tools and protocols are constantly being published, ultimately making it
challenging for any one individual to keep up with the breakneck pace of this field. We started
genPALS (**gen**omics **P**ractical **A**pplications and **L**earning **S**eminar) with the goal of cultivating a supportive community of researchers
at UC Irvine who use genomics as a tool to study their favorite biological
systems. Specifically, this group is for the technicians, graduate students,
and post-docs that actually analyze this data to discuss new methods and share
personal experiences with using genomics tools in their research. We want to know
what works as well as what fails, in hopes of supporting each other in our unified
pursuit of using data to drive discovery.

genPALS is supported by the [NSF-Simons Center for Multiscale Cell Fate Research (CMCF)](https://cellfate.uci.edu/).
